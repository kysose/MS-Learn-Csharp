# MS-Learn-Csharp
My excercises on my freecodeCamp.org Foundational C# with Microsoft path
Contains a currently updating set of excercises I've completed in Microsoft Learn.

For now this repo will contain every Visual Studio Code C# project I make, since I plan on using Visual Studio 2022 as my main C# IDE
while MS Learn uses VS Code instead.
