# MS-Learn-Csharp
My excercises on my freecodeCamp.org Foundational C# with Microsoft path
Contains a currently updating set of excercises I've completed in Microsoft Learn.

For now this repo will contain every Visual Studio Code C# project I make, since I plan on using Visual Studio 2022 as my main C# IDE
while MS Learn uses VS Code instead.

Repository set to private, because not sure if OK to share these publicly, even tho the course material is free. Need to check that up later.
